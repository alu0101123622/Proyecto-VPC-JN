# **COMPUTER VISION PROJECT (DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING)**
### *LINEAR / NON-LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE LEVELS OF GRAY*
Repository in which the code and tests of the first practice of the Computer Vision subject are located.
We have worked with: <https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.

**OBJECTIVES**:
- Creation of the work environment to load, transform and display images
as well as other information elements associated with them.
-  Coding, testing and using linear operations of transformation of the levels
gray on a digital image to change the visual appearance of the image
acting on its brightness and contrast.
- Code, test and use non-linear transformations on gray levels
based on the alteration of the histogram.

This project has been carried out by:
- Jorge Acevedo de León
- Nerea Rodríguez Hernández


**Execution examples:**
> Linear transformations by sections.
